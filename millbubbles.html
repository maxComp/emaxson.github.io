<h3>Bubbles Keep Sawmill Open</h3>

Bubbles of compressed air have come to the rescue of the sawmill operator. Most mills across 
the northern tier of states must close down in winter when ice forms across the ponds in which 
logs are floated to the saws. 
<br><br>Warren Brown of McCall, Idaho, has kept his sawmill open throughout the winter simply 
by laying a perforated pipe along the bottom of the pond and forcing compressed air through it. 
As the bubbles rise to the surface they prevent the formation of ice. Even when the thermometer 
hovered around 26 degrees below zero for two weeks, an area 1200 feet long and 200 feet wide 
remained open. 
<br><br>The air bubbles lighten the warmer water on the bottom and bring it to the surface. 
Thus the water does not reach the freezing point.
