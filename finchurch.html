<h3>Finnish Church</h3>Built in 1917

<p>
The Rev. William Eloheimo became the pastor in 1904 and encouraged the building of a church. 
Soon after, the Finnish Ladies Aid Society, also known as the Finnish Sewing Circle, was formed 
to raise money for the project.<br><br>

In 1913, a 1-1/2 acre parcel was donated in 1913 by Uriel Kantola at the corner of what is now 
Farm to Market Road and Finn Church Lane.<br><br>

John Heikila, Nick Ranta, and John Ruska were contracted as carpenters, along with John Lapinoja 
as the principal builder, according to Leaf's history. Construction costs were just over $1,800.
<br><br>The belfry still contains a bell donated by
a Finnish congregation in Rock Springs, Wyoming, a predominately-Finnish mining
town.
<br><br>
The church's constitution specified that it was not to be used for "any marriage ceremony", 
reception or any other activity that would be inconsistent with our beliefs based on Holy Scripture.
