to Spend an Outing</b><br>

<td><p>Payette Lakes, one of the most beautiful spots in Idaho, with magnificent 
scenery, trout fishing and game of every description--an ideal outing place now has a hotel. 
The name of this new hostelry is Hotel McCall, named after its builder, Thomas McCall, an old 
resident at the lakes and a man of splendid ideas. He appreciated the
magnificent opportunities afforded by the lakes as an outing place and built a resort, where all 
comers can be comfortable while enjoying a summer vacation filled with unalloyed pleasure.
<br><br>
Mr. McCall has leased the hotel to Charles Phillips of Denver, who, with his wife, will 
conduct it. The hotel is a 3-story structure, with 20 large and well furnished sleeping 
rooms on the upper floors and an office, a nicely furnished ladies' parlor. A cozy dining 
room, a model kitchen and other rooms on the first floor. The bulding is new; all the furniture 
is new and up-to-date, the resort in its construction, in its furnishing and in its management 
is such as will fill the days of visitors there with joy. A white chef has been engaged and 
under his observing eye the most toothsome of meals will be served, the intention is to make 
the table one of the most attractive features. Fresh trout, game of all kinds and fruit will be served.<br><br>
The lake, on the banks of which the Hotel McCall stands, is a lovely expanse of water, with 
its 10 miles of glistening surface. It affords opportunities for boating and fishing such as 
can not be secured anywhere in Idaho. The lake is filled with trout, and Mr. McCall is authority
 for the statement that there are more of the speckled beauties awaiting the baits of enthusiastic 
"Waltons" this year than ever before. The surrounding country abounds in all kinds of game, grouse, 
deer, elk, etc, a paradise for the sportsman.<br><br>
Surrounded by a magnificent forest, with lots of grass and beautiful wild shrubbery, it is 
one of the prettiest spots in the state. At the hotel is a
mineral spring, the water of which is becoming noted for its medicinal qualities. 
<br><br>The place is most healthful as many who have visited It can testify. Many women have gone 
there pale, feeble and listless, to come away in a few weeks robust and red-cheeked. 
<br><br>The hotel is 120 miles from Boise, but can be reached from Salubria, at the end of the  Pacific and Idaho Northern Railroad, in a drive of 30 miles. Good riggs can always be secured at Salubria. The hotel rates are reasonable.
Mr. McCall says a general merchandise store is being established there so that all can secure what they want for any camping excursions.
There is a big mineral belt adjacent to the lakes and some good prospects have been opened up there.
