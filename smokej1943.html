<h3>Forest Service will employ Paracutists in McCall Territory</h3>

MCCALL (Special) - A new practice in fire-fighting will be inaugurated in Idaho this year. 
For the first time smoke-jumpers will be employed in combatting fires. These men, equipped 
with parachutes, will jump from planes, landing close to the fire. The group will be stationed in McCall.
<br><br>
The method, which has been used to some extent in the West the last two years, has certain 
distinct advantages. It will prove particularly practical for small fires in inaccessible districts,
 since a plane can reach the area soon after a fire is spotted. Such a blaze might easily grow into a 
fire of sizeable proportions before it could be reached by trail.<br><br>
Officials of the Idaho national forest met with officials of the Nez Perce forest recently to formulate 
plans for maintaining a smoke-Jumper squad this year. The squad will be composed of men who are 
familiar with the practical phases of fire fighting and will number about five. At least one
McCall man, John Ferguson, will leave next week for Missoula,
Mont., where the training in jumping, and the packing and care of the chutes, will be given.
