<h3>Motor car ride described</h3>Idaho Statesman August 5, 1915

Those going from Boise by auto may be interested in the following information given by a member 
of a party escorted to the lake recently by Dr. Titus, and that included Dr. and Mrs. King and 
Mr. Moholin. It is related that the best route is via Star and Emmett, although this party went 
from Star direct to Montour via the "Scotch Bob" ranch. 
<br><br>The road from the latter place to Montour is rough and slow. Going by way of Emmett to 
Montour, while longer would be more comfortable and probably save time. From Montour the route lays
via Sweet.
<br><br> Above Sweet the party took the upper Dry Buck road, following the Dry Buck Lumber company's 
signs. The rest of the road is by way of Smith's Ferry, Thunder City and Roseberry. 
<br><br>The distance 
from Boise by the route here indicated is 125 miles. The time required is from seven to 12 hours, 
according to machine conditions. With a short coupled car, especially a roadster, it is far 
more satisfactory to make a day of it. With the large touring car it can be made easily in 
eight hours. The record is given at slx and a half hours.
