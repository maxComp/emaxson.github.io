The first Finnish immigrants arrived in Long Valley in the 1890s. They 
came from eastern Oregon where they had tried homesteading. Long Valley with its forests, mountains 
and green meadows appealed to them more than the Oregon desert country.<br><br>

 Most of the Finns came to Long Valley between 1900 and 1925.

The largest Finnish community, Elo, was on the Elo Road southeast of present-day McCall. 
<br><br>Named for 
its religious leader and teacher, Rev. John Eloheimo, Elo had a store, post office, school, and a 
meeting hall. Many of Elo's Finns were Lutherans.
