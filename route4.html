In 1912, the task of hewing a railbed out of the granite walls of
the canyon of the North Fork of the Payette River began. All supplies,
materials, and machinery were brought into the canyon over the wagon
road, which had been repaired by the state and railroad contractors.<br><br>
Construction camps were established along the wagon road, and men
crossed the swirling waters to their work on suspension bridges and log
foot bridges. Several lives were lost in crossing. The rails were laid
through the canyon in 1913. <br><br>In the same year, the Idaho Northern
Branch spur reached the gorge or cascade in the Payette River and the
new town of Cascade was born. Train service between Nampa and Payette
Lakes was established in 1914.
