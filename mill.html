The Warren Gold Dredging Company built the first sawmill on the lake in 1896.

Tom McCall purchased that sawmill and sold it in 1910 to the Hoff & Brown Lumber Company. 
McCall transformed into a prosperous mill town when in 1914 Hoff & Brown was awarded
the contract to cut ties for the Union Pacific Railroad. <br><br>In 1915, it took visitors seven to twelve hours to make a road trip from Boise to McCall by car.
 In 1929, Brown bought out Hoff and the company
became Brown's Tie and Lumber Company, which at one time was the largest employer in the
area. The mill burned down in 1940, was rebuilt in 1942. 


<br><br>
The Boise-Cascade Company acquired the mill in 1964 and closed operations in 1977, it burned down in 1984.
