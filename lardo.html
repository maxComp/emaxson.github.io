<p>The Lardo Bridge was designed in 1930 by Idaho State Bridge Engineer
Charles A. Kyle and constructed in 1931 by C. F. Dinsmore and Company of
Ogden, UT. Charles Kyle was the long-time bridge engineer for the State
Bureau of Highways. 
<br><br>
The contract for the bridge alone was awarded in October of 1930 in the
amount of $33,640.00 and was completed (with minor delays) in August of
1931. Approach work at either end of the new bridge brought the total
project cost to $41,309.40, with the federal government shouldering
$24,041.52 (58%), the State of Idaho paying $5,755.96 (14%), and Valley
County providing the remaining $11,511.92 (28%).
<br><br>
In 1930-31, what is now known as SH 55 was part of the Idaho State Highway
System and officially titled the "Payette Highway." Later, the route was
renamed State Highway 15, before the change to the present designation of
State Highway 55.
<br><br>
The construction of this bridge must have provided some welcome employment
in those early days of the Depression.
<br><br>

<b>The new bridge</b> 2017
<br><br>
A unique construction method will be used on the new bridge, and only the
second time it has been used in Idaho. Essentially, using an accelerated
construction technique called lateral slide, a new bridge will be built
along side (north of) the old bridge, the old bridge will be dismantled, and then the new bridge will be slid into place where the old one was. ITD says, "This method significantly reduces the duration of the full closure of the bridge."
<br><br>
ITD says, while construction activity will be noticeable, drivers will not
be impacted by any road closures until after Labor Day (early September).
During the closure, traffic will be detoured to Boydstun Lane.
