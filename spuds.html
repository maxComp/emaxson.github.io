<h3>J.R. SIMPLOT'S LEGACY</h3>

<p>
With a contract scrawled on the back of an envelope, Simplot had an order for 500,000 pounds 
of dried onions and an immediate need for a plant to process them. He wanted to build it at 
Parma, but a man with a deed to the land sicced his dogs on him and he settled on Caldwell.<br><br>
His mechanics were not up to building a boiler and steel had been rationed,  
so he bought the first boiler used for dehydration from the saw mill in McCall idaho in 1940.
The mill had just burned down and J.R. drove his car to McCall to seal the deal.<br><br>
The Caldwell plant, eventually equipped with the world's largest food dehydrator, 
was key to his operation's becoming the largest supplier of potatoes to the military during 
World War II. It supplied one of every three potato portions served to U.S. troops.
By 1945, more than 50 million pounds 
of spuds were being used by the military and, of 156 companies supplying dried food, 
Simplot had one-third of the action.
