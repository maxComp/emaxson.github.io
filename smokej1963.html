<h3>Smokejumper Parachutes Signal Starting of School</h3>
Idaho Statesman June 26, 1963

The first orange parachutes heralding the start of the 20th year of training at the nation's 
second largest smokejumper's school are blossoming in central Idaho skies this week.<br><br>
Thirty new trainees are receiving two weeks of intensive training, including parachuting, 
fire fighting, map and compass reading and intensive physical conditioning.<br><br>
Del Catlin, who heads the Payette National Forest smoke jumpers, says they will join 
an additional 43 experienced jumpers to form an intermountain firefighting nucleus, 
with 20 of the total number to be based at Idaho City and the remainder at McCall. 
<br><br><b>Hazards Vary</b><br>
Predictions as to the 1963 fire hazards are as varied as fire
fighting methods over the past 50 years.
A mild winter with the lowest snowfall on record has combined with a long wet spring. 
Grass grows tall along the Salmon and the Snake, where fires from lightning, or from 
smokers, can mushroom in minutes.<br><br>
But unlike 50 years ago, when most big fires had to burn themselves out, this season's 
fires have an excellent chance of being discovered quickly -- and an equally excellent 
chance of being controlled with as little damage as possible to the nation's most remote forests.
<br><br>
Students and teachers make up the major portion of the jumpers stationed here, and they come 
to McCall, many of them summer after summer, from all sections of the country.
