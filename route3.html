O. R. Price of Smith's Ferry, station engineer for the Idaho Northern railroad, was in Bolse 
yesterday attending to matters of business connected with the road.<br><br>
"The grading of the new road from Emmett to the Payette lake is now practically 
completed as far as Smith's Ferry," said Mr. Price. The track has been built as 
far as Horseshoe Bend, but only construction trains are being run on that portion 
of the road. Regular train service as far as Smith's Ferry will probably be established 
by November 1.
"Excavation work for the new line  has been begun as far as McCall, but  the grading has
 not been completed to that place."
