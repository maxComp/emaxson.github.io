MCCALL-The buzzer at forest service smoke jumper headquarters in McCall which signals the need 
for a Jumper had the busiest season in its history, last summer.  According to Del Catlin, 
smoke jumper chief, there were 422 "buzzes" for individual parachute jumps to fires during the 
1961 season.<br><br>
Organized in 1943, the McCall unit is headquarters for all of Forest Service Region 4, Catlin 
said, comprising southern Idaho, western Wyoming, and all of Utah and Nevada.<br><br>
Jumpers this year were sent to 114 fires on 15 national forests in five states, Idaho, Montana,
 Washington, Oregon, and California. In addition, men from McCall spent three months in Silver 
City, New Mexico making 86 jumps and bringing the total for the McCall unit to more than 500.
<br><br>From all 500 jumps only six minor injuries resulted--all of them, Catlin said, in 
the "sprain, strain and bruises" categories.
When Jumpers don parachutes following the buzz 'indicating a fire, they never know whether 
they'll be jumping on a  small blaze or a large. Fires last summer ranged from lone trees 
struck by lightening to the disastrous Corn Creek Fire on the Salmon national forest covering several 
thousand acres.
