First three guests to register at the opening of the new Shore Lodge Thursday were Jack Simplot,
 Ed Sproat and Carroll Sellars and their families. And they were the only three!<br><br>
Construction problems, which have caused numerous delays, again held up opening of the lodge, but 
22 rooms will be occupied tonight, mostly by Bolseans. The right wing will be completely opened 
Sunday when food service will begin, Ted Turner, manager reported Thursday. 
<br><br>Massive, limed-oak 
furniture was moved into the lobby late Thursday night and all facilities are expected to be 
in operation by Sunday.
McCall weather has been sunny, Turner reported, with the exception of a light 5 o'clock shower Thursday.
