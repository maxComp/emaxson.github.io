Fire destroyed the sawmill of the Brown Tie and Lumber Company and several other buildlings here Tuesday evening
with a loss estimated between $50,000 and $75,000.<br><br>
For a time it was feared gusty winds would sweep the flames through most of the town. Only heroic work by volunteer firemen, residents, Forest Service and CCC crews saved a number of structures nearby.

<br><br>Carl Brown, state senator and Idaho Democratic national committeeman, owner of the sawmill, is in Chicago attending the national Democratic convention.
