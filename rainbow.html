<p>The bridge was designed by Charles A. Kyle, the first chief bridge engineer for the 
Idaho Department of Highways. Construction began in July 1933 and was completed in December, six months later. 
C.C. Dinsmore & Co. of Ogden, Utah, built the bridge. 
<br><br>A monumental achievement in Idaho bridge construction history, reflecting leading-edge engineering 
at the time. It exemplifies a conscious effort to meld a modern structure with a picturesque natural 
setting. 
<br><br>Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the bridge's enduring popularity among 
residents and travelers alike is a tribute to its design. The open-spandrel concrete arches 
stretch 410 feet across the North Fork of the Payette. It is the longest single-span arch bridge 
in the state.
