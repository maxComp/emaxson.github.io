MCCALL (Special)--A new fire on the Idaho national forest was reported under control Saturday. 
The fire, a mile east of Sloan's creek point, and about 20 miles southeast of McCall, was 
quickly brought under control when smoke-Jumpers reached the scene within 15 minutes after 
leaving McCall.<br><br>
A crew of men from McCall Joined the smoke-jumpers and 17 men were left guarding the fire.
Jumpers were Lloyd Johnson, Jerry Hoefer and Keith Utterback. The parachutists jumped from 
an altitude of 1000 feet and landed close to the fire.<br><br>
The fire was the forty-second to be reported on the Idaho national forest this year.
 Only two were burning Saturday. The fire eight miles below Knox in the Kassel district is also 
under control. Forest officials said the forests are getting drier each day and the danger of 
fires is accordingly greater.
