The iconic Shore Lodge opened in 1948 on July 3, along Shellworth Beach on Payette Lake. 

 <br><br>Shore Lodge management 
and shareholders intentionally created a resort-style lodge that was a cozy and intimate
place for locals and tourists, contrasting with the glamor and glitz of the other famous 
Idaho lodge in Sun Valley.<br><br> A private club for nearly a decade, it re-opened to the public 
in 2008.
